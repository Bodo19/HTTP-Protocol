# HTTP-Protocol
Implemented a server communication under a HTTP Protocol
I used simple elements to simulate a real communication like login, register, exit, logout, etc.
A user can modify the data on the server by adding and deleting instances from the server if the user has the right privileges.
I used tokens, IPs, JSON and cookies to simulate the functionality of a real server(users, privileges, actions).
